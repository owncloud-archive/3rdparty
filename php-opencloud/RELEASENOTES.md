### 02/21/2013 Version 1.4
* Added __DIR__ to all internal `require()` calls. [Issue #40]
* Added support for Rackspace Cloud DNS (see the quick reference in docs/
  for the details)
* Other bug fixes that I can't remember, but which are really good. Really.

### 02/10/2013 Version 1.3
* **IMPORTANT**: The file extension for include files is not `.php` (instead of
  `.inc`). This came at the request of numerous individuals. However, it means
  that all of your scripts that use **php-opencloud** must be edited.
* `DataObject::Create()` now uses `content_type`; using the older
  `type` parameter is deprecated and will cause an UnknownParameterError
  exception.
* New global constant `RAXSDK_CACERTPEM`; if defined, this should be a path
  to a `cacert.pem` file that defines the root certificate servers. Defining
  this provides an extra degree of security in the HTTP transfer operations.
* Fixed a bug (issue #25) wherein the entire DataObject was retrieved in the
  constructor. This was incorrect; the constructor now does a `HEAD` request,
  and you need to use the `SaveToFilename()` or `SaveToString()` methods to
  actually fetch the data from Swift/Cloud Files. **If your code relies upon
  the previous behavior, this might cause it to break.**
* Support for Rackspace Cloud Load Balancers
* Fix to remove requirement for Tenant ID in authentication
* Added `ExportCredentials()` and `ImportCredentials()` methods to the
  `OpenStack` class to permit caching of tokens.
