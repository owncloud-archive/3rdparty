# Views

## Info

Views contain a combination of data that usually includes multiple, different objects. The primary purpose of a view is to save API calls and make data retrieval more efficient. Instead of doing multiple API calls and then combining the result yourself, you can perform a single API call against the view endpoint.

## List all Views

```php
$views = $service->getViews();
      
foreach ($views as $view) {
	$entity = $view->getEntity();
    
    echo $view->getTimestamp();
}
 ```
