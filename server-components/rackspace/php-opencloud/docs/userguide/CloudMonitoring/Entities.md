#Â Entities

## Info

An entity is the target of what you are monitoring. For example, you can create an entity to monitor your website, a particular web service, or your Rackspace server. Note that an entity represents only one item in the monitoring system -- if you wanted to monitor each server in a cluster, you would create an entity for each of the servers. You would not create a single entity to represent the entire cluster.

An entity can have multiple checks associated with it. This allows you to check multiple services on the same host by creating multiple checks on the same entity, instead of multiple entities each with a single check.

## Setup

```php
$entity = $service->getEntity();
```

For more information about setting up the `$service` object, please see the userguide tutorial for [services](Service.md).

        'b'       => '127.0.0.5',
        'c'       => '127.0.0.6',

        'of'   => 'stuff',
        'can'  => 'go',

    )
